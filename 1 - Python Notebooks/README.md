# Colab and Python Notebooks

## What we will cover in the lab

- What are Python notebooks? 
    - They are a complete narrative of code and comments that can render many HTML components, such as images, hyperlinks, videos, etc. Therefore, the goal of a notebook is to demonstrate some code or explain some idea in the most engaging way possible.
- What is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)? (click on the link to review)
    - It is a Python notebook that runs on the cloud so you don't need to install anything on your PC. It runs on the browser.
    - Difference between Code and Text/Markdown: A Python notebook contains two types of cells. Today we will deal with the text/markdown part.
- Shortcuts for entering code and markdown mode in Colab.
    - Convert cell to code cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M Y`
    - Convert cell to text/markdown cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M M`
- Introduction to [markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)
    - Headings, bullets, hyperlinks, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc
    - Tables
    - Latex equations in markdown
    - Review [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for markdown features or the shorter [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Images, videos
    - Go [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week1%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/Notebooks_Introduction.ipynb) and review this notebook to see various features and also how to embed images and videos.
- How to [load](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) in Colab an ipynb from Github
- How to execute some Python code in Colab. How to save your notebook in your Google Drive space.
- Autocomplete in Google Colab for code] [optional]
    - When you write Python code in Colab it helps you "autocomplete" the code. Review this [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=d4L9TOP9QSHn)

## Lab structure
1. Introduction of TAs
2. Then, we will take a look at this week's [walkthrough](Walkthrough/BIAlab1walkthrough.ipynb) to get familiar with the topics of the lab.
3. You will do [exercise 1](Exercises/Exercise1.png), where you are asked to recreate a notebook discussing the MSE. This will be done in groups of 3 (10 - 15 mins) and we will then show a sample answer.
4. The last challenge of the day will be [exercise 2](Exercises/Exercice2.png). Similarly to the first exercise, you will be asked to recreate a notebook on Amazon, a bit more technical, but still totally in your range of capabilities. This will also be done in groups of 3 (10 - 15 mins) and we will also show a sample answer.

**AT HOME:** Read the [Notebook Introduction](Walkthrough/Notebooks_Introduction.ipynb). It revisits what we have covered in the lab and will help you get comfortable with the technology we will be using throughout the semester. (It's short!)

## Exercises

 After you have become familiar with Colab you can do the following exercises in groups of 3 (10-15mins each exercise). One team will be randomly picked to share their solution (if they feel confident it is correct!).

- **Exercise 1:** Recreate [this](Exercises/Exercise1.png) in Colab. This may require some knowledge of Latex for recreating the equations, so if you are not very familiar with this just ask your TAs. Links used:
