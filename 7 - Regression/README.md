# Week 8 | Regression

### Material
In this week's lab, you will learn how to make single- and multi-variate linear regressions. More precisely we will cover the following steps:
1. Loading the data (features/target)
2. Splitting the data into training and test sets
3. Data-normalization (MinMaxScaler)
4. Create/fit the regression
5. Retrieve the coefficients
6. Make predictions with the model
7. Metrics to evaluate the model (R2, MAE, MSE)
8. Visualize the regression

**Note:**
 - Steps 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are optional (but usually done)
 - Steps 5, 6, 7, and 8 can be done in any order after step 4

As you will see, regressions are pretty easy in the sense that you will always follow the steps outlined above.

### Lab Structure
1. You will to learn how to do regressions with Python in the [walkthrough](Walkthrough/Walkthrough_Regression.ipynb).
2. Showcase your awsome, newly acquired skills in this week's [exercise](Exercise/Exercise_Regression.ipynb).
