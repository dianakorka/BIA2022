# Data visualization

## What will we cover in this lab?

This week, we are learning to build basic tools to visualize information from a dataset. First, we'll start with classic, static visualization : we will review histograms, boxplots, piecharts, scatter and line plot, and heatmaps. The main goal is for you to be able to create appropriate representations to analyze and communicate easily.

Then, we will take a look at interactive visualization using various new libraires such as ipwidgets, plotly and folium. The goal is to give you an introduction to these different types of data visualization.


## Lab Structure
As usual, we will first take a look at this week's [Walkthrough](Walkthrough_4.ipynb) to get familiar with data visualization. You'll complete small exercises in groups during the lab session.
